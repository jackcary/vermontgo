## Setting Handicap and Komi

For this tournament, game setup and configuration is a shared responsibility of both players.  The tournament organizers will tell you the parings and handicaps, but they can not set up the game for you.

1. The White (stone) player is responsible for creating the Game Challenge

2. The Black (stone) player is accountable for finding the game challenge, setting his/her stone color to black, and setting the handicap and komi. This involves clicking the stone colors for each player in the Game Challenge window.

3. The White (stone) player is responsible for checking the settings before accepting and beginning the game.

## If the game starts with the wrong settings

Resign, close the game and start again with the instructions above until the game settings are correct.  Free games do not impact your rank or rating.

## Marking dead stones at the end of the game

For this tournament, determining which stones are alive/dead at the end of the game is both players' shared responsibility. If there is a dispute (i.e., "is it seki?"), try to agree on an answer before you contact the tournament organizers.  The organizers have the final say on all game results.

## Remember to be nice, have fun, and enjoy your games!

This event is a fun and friendly Go competition. We hope that you enjoy your games. We expect fair play and good sportsmanship. Please take the time to thank your opponent after each game.
