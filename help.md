## What if my opponent does not show up?
- Let the organizers know, we will try to contact your opponent via phone and email. Please be patient as some players are new to KGS. After 15 minutes from the start of the round, you automatically win via forfeit/time.

## What if my opponent leaves the game in progress?
- Please be patient as some players may have technical or connection difficulties depending on Internet service quality.  If the time runs out on the game, you win by default.

## Our game started with the wrong settings/color/handicap, now what?
- Communicated with your opponent via chat that the settings are wrong.  Resign the game and start/setup a new game with the correct settings.  Please try to do this quickly so that the round can finish on time.

## How do I finish the game to determine the result?
- The game ends when both players pass or if one player resigns or runs out of time.  For this tournament, determining and marking which stones are alive/dead at the end of the game is both players' shared responsibility. If there is a dispute (i.e., "is it seki?"), try to agree on an answer before you contact the tournament organizers. The organizers have the final say on all game results.

## What do I do if my opponent is chatting too much or being rude during the game?
- We expect fair play and good sportsmanship.  If your opponent is rude or overly distracting, let the organizers know, and we can decide if the action merits a default result for your opponent.

## Can I use AI, game analysis, books, joseki dictionaries, or ask other players about my game in progress?
- No.  This event is a fun, friendly, and relaxed event, and we highly doubt this will be an issue. Organizers have the final say on all tournament game results.

## I'm not having fun; what do I do?
- This is a friendly competition, don't take it too seriously! Focus on playing your best moves and finding the beauty in the game.  After the tournament, it's always a great idea to review your games with other players and learn something new!

## Is that Othello?
No.

## I have a question that is not on this list!
No problem, contact the organizers before the tournament begins, and we will add your question and answer here!
