## What if my opponent does not show up?
Let the orgainsers know, we will try to contact your opponent via phone and email. Please be patient as some players are new to KGS. After 15 minutes from the start of the round you automatically win via forfeit/time.

## What if my opponent leaves the game in progress?
Please be patient as some players are new to KGS and may have technical or connection difficulties depending on Internet service quality.  If the time runs out on the game, you win via time.

## Our game started with the wrong settings/color/handicap, now what?
Communicated with your opponent via chat that the settings are wrong.  Resign the game and start/setup a new game with the correct settings.  Please try to do this quickly so that the round can finish ontime.

## How to I finish the game to determine the result?
The game ends when both players pass, or if one player resigns or runs out of time.  For this tournament, determining and marking which stones are alive/dead at the end of the game is both players’ shared responsibility. If there is a dispute (i.e., “is it seki?”), try to agree on an answer before you contact the tournament organizers. The organizers have the final say on all game results.
